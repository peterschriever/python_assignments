Python assignments for school, theme: 2.1 Computer Systems. Group: D6, Duo: 49.

## Notice!
The code used in these assignments may be of low quality due to the nature of these assignments. An example would be the many duplicates of code in the assignments_week1.py file. We are continously redefining the list L, L1 and L2 because it is required for the assignment. Please keep this fact in mind when using our code.
